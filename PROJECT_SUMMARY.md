# Project Summary: Unit Converter App

## Tech Stack Used
- **Backend**: Python with Flask framework
- **Frontend**: JavaScript with React
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth 2.0
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with responsive design
- **Deployment**: Ready for Heroku, JetBrains Space, or Docker

## Challenges and Solutions
1. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Implemented proper CORS configuration to allow secure communication between the frontend and backend.
2. **Session Management**: Used Flask-Session to maintain user authentication state securely.
3. **Google OAuth Integration**: Implemented OAuth flow with proper redirect handling and token management.

## Future Improvements (with more time)
1. **Additional Unit Conversions**: Expand beyond meters to feet to include multiple unit types (temperature, weight, volume, etc.)
2. **User History**: Store conversion history for each user
3. **Enhanced UI**: Add animations and more interactive elements
4. **Progressive Web App**: Convert to PWA for offline functionality
5. **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization for global users
